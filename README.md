This repo contatins my approach to make an async web scrapper that collects data in `json` format from russian book store [Book24.ru](https://book24.ru).

The way you can use it:

1. Launch `AIO-Books24.py` with additional argument as you query to the [Book24.ru](https://book24.ru).
2. The loading prosess may take some time to conduct all requests and after a while the programme creates the `.json` format file with all gathered books.
3. !!**NOTE**!! Due to the fact that it is my first approach in async web-scrapping, I am pretty sure that lots of mistakes were made. Will be very glad for any assisstance in bug fixing.
4. Example of a request: `python3 AIO-Books24.py JavaScript`.
